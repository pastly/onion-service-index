<h1><a href='?page=1'>The</a> longest and least useful onion index in the galaxy</h1>
<p id='about'>
This website lists <em>literally</em> every onion service.
If you're looking for a complete index,
it doesn't get any more complete than this.
<ul>
<li>We list all {{ num_onions }} onions.
<li>We list onions that used to be online.
<li>We list onions that are not online yet.
<li>We list onions that are impossible to access without
<a href='https://matt.traudt.xyz/p/GmiiUPQL.html'>the proper authorization</a>.
<li>And here and there, you'll find onion services that are actually online
right now.
</ul>

<h2>Long lists are dumb</h2>
<p>
We think the race to see who can generate the longest list of onion services is
silly, so we made the longest possible. We win. Everyone can stop now.
</p>
<p>
Lists are only useful if they are maintained and curated. Most lists out there
are neither. Therefore they are only marginally more useful than this one.
</p>

<h2>There aren't many onion services</h2>
<p>
The truth of the matter is <em>there isn't very many online onion services</em>.
Of those that are online, most aren't worth visiting.
They're scams, phising attempts, or low-traffic forums that are going to stop
existing after a week.
You should very quickly realize this after using a "real" index or search
engine.
No, your inability to find awesome sercrets or spooky media is
<strong>not</strong> because you haven't found the right index/search engine.
<strong>It's because that stuff isn't there</strong>.
At least not on the "deep web."
</p>

<h2>Please feed this website to crawlers</h2>
<p>If you have permission.</p>
<p>
Many of the indexes out there are written as a little side hobby project.
They sometimes use crawlers to find additional links and to check if onion
services are still online periodically.
I don't necessarily think there's much harm in these side projects.
But sometimes I don't think the crawlers are that well-written.
I have a hunch that some of them out there would choke if given a ton of new
unique domains.
So if you want to stress test your crawler, feel free to point it at this
website.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>How long did this take to make?</h3>
<p>Just one afternoon, or two if you count Ben Mintz's contribution.</p>

<h3>Does this take a lot of disk space?</h3>
<p>No. I generate pages as necessary. I cache them too. And no, it should be
impossible for you to make my server run out of disk space.</p>

<h3>This index sucks</h3>
<p>Yup. And that's not a question.</p>

<h3>Where can I actually find links?</h3>
<p>I think <a href='https://ahmia.fi'>Ahmia</a> is the most likely search engine
to stick around. I like the way
<a href='http://zlal32teyptf4tvi.onion'>Fresh Onions</a> looks.</p>

<h3>I can't find any interesting links</h3>
<p>Maybe because there isn't anything interesting to find. And that's also not a
question.</p>

<h3>Well actually [something about next generation onion services]</h3>
<p>You're right! This index doesn't include any of the next generation of onion
services! As of May 2017, the naming scheme hasn't been finalized. It's kind
of hard to index something that (i) doesn't exist yet, and (ii) doesn't have a
naming scheme set in stone yet.</p>

<h3>Can't I make foo.xyz.onion and bar.xyz.onion? They don't show up on
this list.</h3>
<p>Sure. If you own xyz.onion and figure out how to host different websites at
subdomains of xyz.onion, that's pretty cool I suppose. But here's why I don't
think that makes this any less of a complete list.</p>
<p>An "onion service" isn't necessarily a website. If we decide to define it as
"a name that connects you to a specific Tor client," then foo.xyz.onion and
bar.xyz.onion are the same onion service. They are both going to the Tor client
serving xyz.onion.</p>
<p>Tor doesn't handle subdomains like that. If you go through the process of
hosting two websites at the same onion domain, you'll realize you have to do it
at the level of the webserver. Tor ignores subdomains.</p>

<h3>Has anybody actually asked you any of these questions?</h3>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
